PRACTICAL NO -7 - NER ON TEXT
# Install necessary libraries
# pip install spacy

import spacy

# Load pre-trained spaCy NER model (en_core_web_sm)
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Example Text for NER
text = """Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, was born in Pretoria, South Africa. 
He moved to the United States in 1992 and later founded Tesla Inc. 
Tesla's stock is worth $800 per share. Musk is also known for his work on Neuralink and The Boring Company."""

# Step 1: Process the Text using spaCy
doc = nlp(text)

# Step 2: Extract and classify named entities
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]

# Step 3: Print extracted entities and their classification
print("Extracted Entities:")
for entity in entities:
    print(f"{entity[0]} ({entity[1]})")
