Description:
What is an N-Gram Model?
An N-Gram model is a probabilistic model that represents a sequence of words of length N. It helps capture word dependencies and context in a given text dataset. The model assumes that the occurrence of a word depends only on the previous N-1 words, making it a Markov model.
This means that the probability of a word depends only on the last N-1 words, reducing computational complexity.
Types of N-Gram Models
N-Gram Type
Definition
Example (Sentence: "I love natural language processing")
Unigram (N=1)
Individual words, no context
['I', 'love', 'natural', 'language', 'processing']
Bigram (N=2)
Two-word sequences, captures short-term dependencies
[('I', 'love'), ('love', 'natural'), ('natural', 'language'), ('language', 'processing')]
Trigram (N=3)
Three-word sequences, captures longer dependencies
[('I', 'love', 'natural'), ('love', 'natural', 'language'), ('natural', 'language', 'processing')]

For larger values of N, the model captures better context but also becomes computationally expensive.
Methodology
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Before applying the N-Gram model, we preprocess the text using the following steps:
Convert text to lowercase to maintain consistency.


Remove punctuation and special characters to clean the text.


Tokenization – Splitting text into words.


Stopword removal – Removing common words like "the," "is," "and," etc.


Lemmatization – Converting words to their base form (e.g., "running" → "run").


Step 2: Generating N-Grams
Using the processed text, we generate Unigrams, Bigrams, and Trigrams to analyze word relationships.
Step 3: Frequency Distribution of N-Grams
Count the occurrence of each N-Gram in the text.


Visualize the most common N-Grams to identify frequent patterns.


Step 4: Comparison with Other Text Representation Models

Description
Advantages
Disadvantages
Bag-of-Words (BoW)
Counts word occurrences without considering order
Simple and effective for text classification
Ignores word order and context
TF-IDF
Weighs words based on importance in the document
Highlights significant words, reducing noise
Still ignores word order
N-Gram Model
Captures word sequences to retain some context
Preserves word dependencies
High computational cost for large N

Applications of N-Gram Models
The N-Gram model is widely used in various NLP applications:
Text Prediction & Autocomplete – Used in keyboards (e.g., Google Predictive Search, SwiftKey).


Speech Recognition – Converts spoken words into text using sequential probability models.


Machine Translation – Helps in phrase-based language translation (e.g., Google Translate).


Plagiarism Detection – Compares N-Grams between different texts to find similarity.


Sentiment Analysis – Identifies patterns in text related to positive or negative sentiment.
Conclusion:
The N-Gram model is a fundamental NLP technique that captures word dependencies and improves contextual understanding in text processing. While Unigrams analyze individual words, Bigrams and Trigrams preserve relationships between words, making them useful for text prediction, machine translation, and speech recognition. However, as N increases, computational complexity grows, and deep learning models like Transformers and BERT have largely surpassed traditional N-Grams in modern NLP applications. Despite this, N-Gram models remain essential for tasks requiring interpretable and efficient text analysis.

Description:
Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, monetary values, and more from text data. NER is widely used in applications like information retrieval, text summarization, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and search engines.
NER models are typically implemented using rule-based approaches, statistical models, or deep learning techniques. Modern NLP libraries, such as spaCy, NLTK, Stanford NER, and Hugging Face Transformers, provide pre-trained models for entity extraction, reducing the need for manual annotations and extensive training.
Methods for Implementing NER
A. Rule-Based Approach
Uses manually crafted rules, regular expressions, and linguistic patterns.


Example: A rule like If "Mr." appears before a word, classify it as a PERSON.


Limitations: Not scalable for large datasets, fails with informal text.


B. Statistical and Machine Learning-Based NER
Uses algorithms like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and Decision Trees.


Learns from labeled datasets and makes predictions based on probabilities.


Examples: Stanford NER, CRF-based NER models.


C. Deep Learning-Based NER
Uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTM), and Transformers.


Captures long-range dependencies and improves entity recognition.


Examples:


spaCy's pre-trained models


BERT-based models from Hugging Face


Named Entity Categories
NER systems classify entities into various categories:
Entity Type
Description
PERSON
Names of people (e.g., "Elon Musk", "Barack Obama")
ORGANIZATION
Company names (e.g., "Google", "NASA")
LOCATION
Cities, countries, states (e.g., "New York", "India")
DATE
Specific dates (e.g., "March 20, 2024")
TIME
Time expressions (e.g., "10:30 AM")
MONEY
Currency amounts (e.g., "$100", "50 euros")
PERCENT
Percentages (e.g., "90% accuracy")

Evaluation Metrics for NER Models
To measure the accuracy of an NER system, the following evaluation metrics are used:
Precision: Measures how many extracted entities are correct.
 Precision=TruePositivesTruePositives+FalsePositivesPrecision = \frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Positives}Precision=TruePositives+FalsePositivesTruePositives​
Recall: Measures how many actual entities were correctly identified.
 Recall=TruePositivesTruePositives+FalseNegativesRecall = \frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Negatives}Recall=TruePositives+FalseNegativesTruePositives​
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, balancing both.
 F1−Score=2×Precision×RecallPrecision+RecallF1-Score = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}F1−Score=2×Precision+RecallPrecision×Recall​
Applications of NER
Information Extraction: Extracts key entities from news articles and research papers.


Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Identifies user queries related to specific persons, locations, or products.


Healthcare NLP: Recognizes diseases, medications, and patient names in clinical texts.


Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Helps improve content indexing and search relevance.


Social Media Analysis: Extracts trends and public figures mentioned in posts and tweets.

Conclusion:
NER plays a crucial role in text processing, information retrieval, and AI-driven applications. With advancements in deep learning and transformer-based models, modern NER systems achieve higher accuracy and contextual understanding. However, challenges like handling ambiguous entity names, multilingual NER, and domain-specific entity recognition remain open areas for research. Future improvements may focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models on custom datasets to enhance NER performance for specific applications.
